        <p class="prog-title">What is Chemical Engineering</p>
        <br>
        <p class="prog-text">Chemical engineering is a multi-disciplinary branch of engineering that combines natural and experimental sciences (such as chemistry and physics), along with life sciences (such as biology, microbiology, and biochemistry) plus mathematics and economics to design, develop, produce, transform, transport, operate and manage the industrial processes that turn raw materials into valuable products.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many of the processes within chemical engineering involve chemical reactions, and the field takes cues from chemists who are looking for new ways to create products and to investigate the mechanisms within chemical reactions. Chemical engineers then translate this chemical information to formulate designs. Conventionally, Chemical Engineering has been associated with petroleum, fuel combustion, and reaction systems, and still, it found most relevant branch for these sectors. In recent times, it has also found its way into new developments in fields of, textiles, medicine, microelectronics, & healthcare. This wide range of applications is made possible only due to the complex relationships of chemical engineering principles fundamental with basic sciences like chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology and materials science.

        <!-- UG -->

        <p class="prog-title" id="prog-title-ug">B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering</p>
        <br>
        <p class="prog-text">B. Tech Chemical Engineering is an undergraduate program which is of a total of 4 years duration, divided into 8 semesters. The candidates who have passed 12th or any equivalent degree in any Science stream can pursue a course in B. Tech. Chemical Engineering. Through this course, the students are provided with a curriculum of the specialised concept of Chemical Engineering with in-depth theoretical and practical knowledge of Chemical management and extraction concepts. The various areas of concepts which are covered by B. Tech. in Chemical Engineering course include Chemistry, Solid and Mechanics, Chemical Engineering basics, petrochemicals, Chemical Plant Designing and Operations, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            The selection of candidates for admission to B. Tech. Chemical Engineering course is done either through direct admission or through a national level entrance exam such as JEE Mains, etc. Student are requested to kindly visit to University home page for lasted update.

        <!-- PG -->

        <p class="prog-title">Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering</p>
        <br>
        <p class="prog-text">Doctorate or PhD in Chemical Engineering is a research based doctoral program, the duration of which ranges from 3 to 5 years. This course involves advanced study of concepts including Compounds and Complexes, Reaction Engineering, Energy, Environment, Process Optimization etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            Admission to PhD Chemical Engineering program will be done based on the candidate's performance in the entrance examinations organised by the University. The candidates will also have to appear for Personal Interview after qualifying in the entrance exam.
