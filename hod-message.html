        <p class="" style="width: 90%; word-spacing: 2%; padding: 2% 2% 2% 2%; height: auto; text-align: justify;"> On the behalf of Department of Chemical Engineering, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, I welcome to visitor. Department was established in year 2016 and approved by All India Council for Technical Education, New Delhi. Department of Chemical Engineering is started in the year 2016 with a total intake of 60 students and first batch graduate in year 2020. Department strives for the all-round development of students’ and nurtures them to cater the need of industry and society. Teaching and learning in Department not restricted to the classroom and prepare them for industry. We always strive to provide them life learning skills and as results of this more than of 15% student joined higher degree program at premium institutes of India like IIMs, IITs, NITs, etc. Two students received MEXT fellowship of Japanese government for higher education in Japan. During COVID pandemic situation more than 50% got jobs in public and private sector. One of student joined as Assistant Scientific officer at IGCAR, Kalpakkam and two start their own firm. Department cannot be flourished without the active involvement and dedication of faculty. Faculty members of Chemical Engineering are recognized for their research and educational impact through their experiential skills. They are members of a variety of professional organizations. Our department is exponentially growing by leaps and bounds and our impact in chemical engineering education and research is poised for continual growth in the years ahead.

            There are many questions in mind of student what is about the chemical engineering and what they do and developed. Chemical Engineering makes the life of common person very easy by providing the quality products when they wake in morning and goes to sleep in night. Every product and service used is made by Chemical Engineers. In four year of bachelor program student able to design and develop the process which involves the basic understating of material & energy balance, heat transfer, fluid flow operations, mass transfer, reaction engineering, process dynamics and control and many other chemical, physical, biological transformation principals to deliver the best to mankind. Chemical Engineering is borderless branch in Engineering which enjoys the company with all stream of sciences such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology with due consideration to principles of economics, safety, and environmental protection. There is tremendous scope for chemical engineers and rightly said many noble laureates “Chemical Engineer will be never unemployed in life”.

            <br><br>
            
            Society accept fact that Chemical Engineers are highly innovative, creative, and critical thinkers with versatile problem-solving skills. They play key role in any organization and work with any consultation with inter- and multi-disciplinary teams of professionals. Chemical Engineers thought process is very clear to define problems, determine objectives, plan, and conduct research, and then design, develop, and implement computerized and controlled processes for product manufacturing. Chemical engineering is a diverse discipline which adapts to the changing needs of society, also referred to as universal engineering.

            <br><br>
            
            Environment at our University very liberal and I am very much confident about graduating student from Chemical Engineering Department, they delivery best to the industry and perform better than expectation of society.
