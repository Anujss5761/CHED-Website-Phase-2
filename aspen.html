        <p class="career-text">On March 13 & March14, 2024 IIChE Student Chapter and Department of Chemical Engineering, MMMUT 
			successfully organised an industrial visit at “Avadh Sugar And Energy Ltd. New India Sugar Mills Hata 
			Kushinagar” under guidance of  Dr. Shambhoo Sharan & Dr. Deepshikha Singh. Avadh Sugar and Energy 
			ltd comes under KK Birla Group, a leading name in the sugar industry. The plant has a crushing capacity of 
			about 7,000 tonnes of sugarcane per day and a Co-Generation Power Plant capacity of 35 MW Power. A total 
			of 70 students form 2nd year of chemical engineering branch were visited at Industry.

			The purpose of the industrial visit was to gain insights into various operations, processes, and technologies 
			involved in the manufacturing of sugar. During the visit, the group was taken on a comprehensive tour of the 
			industry floor, where they observed the manufacturing processes in action. From raw material processing to 
			final product assembly, each stage of production was explained in detail by Senior Engineers. A highlight of 
			the visit was learning about the company's rigorous quality control measures. The group gained an 
			understanding of how the company ensures the quality and consistency of its products through various testing 
			and inspection processes. The group learned about the role of advanced machinery in streamlining production 
			processes and improving efficiency.
